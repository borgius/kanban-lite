# Changelog

All notable changes to the Kanban Lite extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `kl mcp` CLI command — starts the MCP server over stdio, allowing `kanban-lite` to be used as the `command` in MCP client config (e.g. `npx kanban-lite mcp`)

### Changed
- Renamed all internal "Feature" terminology to "Card" across the entire codebase (types, functions, variables, components, CLI, MCP, REST API, extension commands)
- `FeatureCard` component → `CardItem`, `FeatureEditor` → `CardEditor`, `CreateFeatureDialog` → `CreateCardDialog`, `FeatureHeaderProvider` → `CardHeaderProvider`
- `featuresDir` → `kanbanDir` throughout SDK, CLI, standalone server, and MCP server
- `KANBAN_FEATURES_DIR` env var → `KANBAN_DIR` (old name kept as fallback alias)
- VS Code command `kanban-lite.addFeature` → `kanban-lite.addCard`
- Zustand store: `features` → `cards`, `setFeatures` → `setCards`, `addFeature` → `addCard`, etc.
- All WebSocket/extension message types updated (`createFeature` → `createCard`, etc.)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- Board and card detail zoom settings with slider UI (75–150%) stored in `.kanban.json`
